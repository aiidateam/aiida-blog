# aiida-blog

This repository is now archived and read-only. Instead, blog posts are being published directly through our website at the following link:
- https://aiida.net/news/index.html

which is hosted in the following GitHub repository:
- https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-website/

It still contains the branch `chris-branch` with the draft [PR #3](https://github.com/aiidateam/aiida-blog/pull/3), which is kept here for future reference, while we migrate the contents of the contained blog posts to the AiiDA website.
