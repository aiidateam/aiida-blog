AiiDA user stories
------------------

This section contains a collection of stories inspired in real life situations and use-cases of AiiDA.
You can use these stories to get a general feeling of what can be done with the code and what is like to work with it, as well as taking the procedures in them as templates for when you need to perform similar tasks.

Each story will specify at the begining which version of the `Quantum Mobile <https://www.materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile>`_ was used in its design/tests.
Using the correct virtual machine and creating a new profile that starts from a clean database (see the ``quicksetup`` command in the `AiiDA documentation <https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/intro/get_started.html#initialise-data-storage>`_) ensures the reproducibility of the commands if you want to test them out yourself.
Any other further setups required (such as importing databases) will be described in the introduction of the story.

Here is the list of currently available user stories:
